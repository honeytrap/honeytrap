# LibDisco

The `libdisco` package contained in this folder is a **plug-and-play** secure protocol and library based on the [Noise protocol framework](https://noiseprotocol.org) and [Strobe protocol framework](https://strobe.sourceforge.io). It has been implemented following the same patterns used in [crypto/tls](https://golang.org/pkg/crypto/tls/).

This has use cases close to TLS: it allows you to encrypt communications.

**This software is experimental. You must not use this in production.**
