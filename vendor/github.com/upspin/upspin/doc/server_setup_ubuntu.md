# Running `upspinserver` on Ubuntu 16.04

These instructions are part of the instructions for
[Setting up `upspinserver`](/doc/server_setup.md).
Please make sure you have read that document first.

## Introduction

These instructions assume you have access to an Debian or Ubuntu linux
server, and that the server is reachable at your chosen host name.
(`upspin.example.com`)

> Note that these instructions have been verified to work against Ubuntu 16.04.
> The exact commands may differ on your system.

Once the server is running you should log in to it as root and configure it to
run `upspinserver` by following these instructions.

## Create a user for `upspinserver`

The following commands must be executed on the server as the super user, `root`,
perhaps via `sudo su`.

Create a Unix account named `upspin`.
For the password, use a secure password generator to create a long, unguessable
password.
Don't worry if it's unwieldy, you won't need to type it again.
The rest of the questions it asks should have sane defaults, so pressing
Enter for each should be sufficient.

```
$ adduser upspin
```

Give yourself SSH access to the `upspin` account on the server (a convenience):

```
$ su upspin
$ cd $HOME
$ mkdir .ssh
$ chmod 0700 .ssh
$ cat > .ssh/authorized_keys
(Paste your SSH public key here and type Control-D and Enter)
```

## Build `upspinserver` and copy it to the server

From your workstation, run these commands:

```
$ GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build upspin.io/cmd/upspinserver
$ scp upspinserver upspin@upspin.example.com:.
```

## Run `upspinserver` on server startup

The following commands must be executed on the server as the super user, `root`.

These instructions assume that your Linux server is running `systemd`.

Create the file `/etc/systemd/system/upspinserver.service` that contains
the following service definition.

```
[Unit]
Description=Upspin server

[Service]
ExecStart=/home/upspin/upspinserver -https=localhost:8443
User=upspin
Group=upspin
Restart=on-failure

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

> Note that here we pass the flag `-https=localhost:8443` to the server,
> instructing it to listen on a high port on `localhost`.
> While we do want our `upspinserver` to serve requests port `443` on our
> public IP address, only the `root` user can bind to ports below `1024` and we
> don't want to run upspinserver as the super user.
> In the next section of this document we will configure the server to redirect
> requests to port `443` to `localhost:8443`.

Use `systemctl` to enable the service:

```
$ systemctl enable /etc/systemd/system/upspinserver.service
```

Use `systemctl` to start the service:

```
$ systemctl start upspinserver.service
```

You may also use `systemctl stop` and `systemctl restart` to
stop and restart the server, respectively.

You can use `journalctl` to see the log output of the server:

```
$ journalctl -f -u upspinserver.service

```

## Redirect port `443` to `localhost:8443`

The following commands must be executed on the server as the super user, `root`.

Install the `xinetd` server, which will run as `root` listening on port `443`
and redirecting requests to our `upspinserver` on `localhost:8443`.

```
$ apt-get install xinetd
```

Create a file `/etc/xinetd.d/upspinserver` with this contents:

```
service upspinserver
{
        disable         = no
        flags           = REUSE
        wait            = no
        user            = root
        socket_type     = stream
        protocol        = tcp
        port            = 443
        redirect        = localhost 8443
        log_on_success  -= PID HOST DURATION EXIT
}
```

Open `/etc/services` and find the line for the `https` service.
It should look something like this:

```
https	443/tcp
```

Then append the string `upspinserver` to that line, so it looks like this:

```
https	443/tcp	upspinserver
```

Finally, restart `xinetd` to enable this configuration:

```
$ systemctl restart xinetd.service
```

## Continue

You can now continue following the instructions in
[Setting up `upspinserver`](/doc/server_setup.md).
