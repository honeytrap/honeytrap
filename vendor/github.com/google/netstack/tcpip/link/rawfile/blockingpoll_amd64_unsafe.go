// Use go:linkname to call into the runtime. As of Go 1.12 this has to
// be done from Go code so that we make an ABIInternal call to an
// ABIInternal function; see https://golang.org/issue/27539.

// We need to call both entersyscallblock and exitsyscall this way so
// that the runtime's check on the stack pointer lines up.

// Note that calling an unexported function in the runtime package is
// unsafe and this hack is likely to break in future Go releases.

//go:linkname entersyscallblock runtime.entersyscallblock

//go:linkname exitsyscall runtime.exitsyscall

// These forwarding functions must be nosplit because 1) we must
// disallow preemption between entersyscallblock and exitsyscall, and
// 2) we have an untyped assembly frame on the stack which can not be
// grown or moved.
