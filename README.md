### Honeytrap is an extensible and opensource system for running, monitoring and managing honeypots. 

## Features

* Combine multiple services to one honeypot, eg a LAMP server
* Honeytrap Agent will download the configuration from the Honeytrap Server
* Use the Honeytrap Agent to redirect traffic out of the network to a seperate network
* Deploy a large amount agents while having one Honeytrap Server, configuration will be downloaded automatically and logging centralized
* Payload detection to determine which service should handle the request, one port can handle multiple protocols
* Monitor lateral movement within your network with the Sensor listener. The sensor will complete the handshake (in case of tcp), and store the payload
* Create high interaction honeypots using the LXC or remote hosts directors, traffic will be man-in-the-middle proxied, while information will be extracted
* Extend honeytrap with existing honeypots (like cowrie or glutton), while using the logging and listening framework of Honeytrap
* Advanced logging system with filtering and logging to Elasticsearch, Kafka, Splunk, Raven, File or Console
* Services are easily extensible and will extract as much information as possible
* Low- to high interaction Honeypots, where connections will be upgraded seamless to high interaction
